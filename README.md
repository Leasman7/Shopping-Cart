# Shopping-Cart
This is a basic shopping cart app using strapi as a database to fetch from. The products can be added to the cart until the stock runs out; items can be removed from the cart; selected items show up in checkout with totalled price of all selected products. Products can be restocked using fetch from strapi.

## How to Run:
Download strapi using instructions from strapi.io. Set up your account on strapi and then prepare products so that they run on your localhost:1337. Should include product name, country, cost, and amount instock. Run local server with images, index, and jsx files. 

## Roadmap
Further styling  would improve the app. It could use a better set-up for the buttons so that is is more obvious what everything does (removing items from the cart isn't particularly user-friendly at the moment). It would also be nice if the restock feature added to the current stock rather than appearing in a new list.
